description: "Israel has introduced one of the world's toughest curbs on bank executives' salaries in an effort to narrow a big pay gap between bosses and workers. The legislation was pushed through by the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, who, before last year's parliamentary elections, ran on a platform of lowering the cost of living and reforming Israel's banks."
